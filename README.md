## How it works

With **ClipplyCloud** you can share files with anyone, and all files expire after 30 minutes, so you don't need to delete them. You also don't need to create an account to use this service. As long as you are using the same browser, all your files will be available for you.

## Design
The user interface of this project was built by me [on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/J181HwJn1RFvYDrAyFkPXd/Clippy-Cloud?node-id=1%3A2).
